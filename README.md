# Real-time Notifications with NATS and Go

Welcome to the Real-time Notifications with NATS and Go repository! In this project, we'll explore the implementation of real-time notifications using the NATS messaging system and the Go programming language. By building this application, you'll gain valuable insights into creating responsive and engaging applications with instant notifications.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how to utilize the NATS messaging system to enable real-time notifications in a Go-based application. We'll explore how to set up event communication, publish and subscribe to events, and integrate this functionality into a responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Event Communication:** Implement a robust event-driven architecture using NATS to facilitate instant communication between application components.
- **User Activity Tracking:** Showcase the tracking of user activities as events, and generate real-time notifications for relevant actions.
- **Subscription Management:** Allow users to subscribe to specific event types and receive immediate updates when those events occur.

## Technologies Used

- **NATS:** The core messaging system that enables real-time event communication between application components.
- **Go:** Utilize the Go programming language to build the backend server, handle event processing, and manage real-time notifications.
